### Project Overview and Significance by Juxtaphony Project Team
This project aims to minimize the risk of viral infection in "dense" conditions. Talking in a dense environment increases the risk of droplet infection, but "not talking" is impossible in daily life. Therefore, it has been reported that speaking in a whispered voice can reduce the amount of viruses and bacteria in the mouth. If we can realize "whispering" conversations, it will be possible to restore the social activities that were possible before the epidemic by wearing masks and avoiding groups.
In this context, this project team would like to focus on and utilize "throat microphones" (also called throat microphones or bone conduction microphones) that can pick up small sounds at the throat to realize "whispered voice" conversations. In addition, by developing an application "SILENT - talking" using Bluetooth (a wireless communication function attached to smartphones, computers, etc.), we believe that we can quickly create an environment that is easy to use a throat microphone to realize conversations using a throat microphone. 

### What is a "throat microphone"?
A "throat microphone" is a microphone that picks up voice through bone conduction around the larynx, and can pick up voice even in noisy or windy environments (Figure 1 on the right). Other types of microphones do not work well in the above environments due to high background noise. The higher the quality of the microphone, the more it can pick up "whispers" and thus enable communication with very little vocal volume.

form Wikipedia：： ["Throat Microphone"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throat_microphone)
>A throat microphone, also called a laryngophone, is a type of contact microphone that absorbs vibrations directly from the wearer's throat by way of single or dual sensors worn against the neck. The sensors, called transducers, can pick up speech even in extremely noisy or windy environments, such as on a motorcycle or in a nightclub. Other types of microphones do not function well under these conditions because of high levels of background noise. Advanced laryngophones are able to pick up whispers, and therefore perform well in environments where communicating with others at a distance in silence is required, such as during covert military or law enforcement operations. Throat microphones are also very useful when helmets or respiratory protection is required. Many full-face SCBA, CABA, SAR Respirator, Elastomeric Respirator, N95 Respirator PAPR, or re-breather masks do not have a provision for a microphone inside the mask. The throat microphone can be used safely, as it is positioned outside the mask's face seal and as such does not compromise the respiratory protection provided by the mask, nor does it violate mask approvals and certification.
>With the advent of COVID-19 in 2020, throat microphone usage has expanded into other areas such as Hospital Emergency Rooms [1], Retail & Restaurants. This is because universal face mask usage and clear plastic physical dividers to enforce social distancing, has made face to face communications much more challenging with people having to raise their voice significantly to communicate.

### What is "SILENT - talking"?
We will develop an application that enables "SILENT - talking" to talk with a throat microphone using Bluetooth. This application provides four modes (Table 1 on the right) and can be used in all situations in daily life such as lectures and classes at school, cafes, dinner parties, and meetings in offices. It can be used to reduce the risk to the maximum when a group of people get together. It can also be carried anywhere and can be used on a daily basis by wearing it around your neck.

Chart１　4 Modes and the Contents on SILENT - talking
| Mode | Number of people |Contents |
|------|------|------|
| Ad-hoc | One-to-One | Enabling voice calls via Bluetooth |
| Party| Multitude | Enabling voice calls through host devices | 
| Table-talk | Multitude | Realization of  random voice conversation in a fixed space |
| Classroom | One-to-Multitude | Realization of lectures and classes through voice conversation via host devices |

# What does the Juxtaphony Project do works?
"Jaxtaphony" is a word coined by combining "Jaxta" and "osteophony".
This project mainly do 2 works.
- Create original data-set for throat microphone
- Create original an application used Bluetooth and filtered to improve throat microphone sound
